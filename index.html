You looked like an angel.” -Saved Soul ♪♫ &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“There is a heart in the Goop House. There is a pair of lungs in the Goop House. There is a sheet of skin in the Goop House. The Music is so alive it’s intoxicating.” -Twitter User ♪♫ &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“I’m made of a thick, gooey, yet runny substance with a consistency somewhere between that of paint and custard. I wasn’t always like this. The Goop made me like this. I glow neon green in the precense of angels.” -Goop House Member #72 ♪♫ &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“They’re weird.” -Instagram user ♪♫ &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“THE GOOP HOUSE is a collection of artists— no, wait, they’re poets. They gather in the woods at night, which scares me a little. Many of them are off-putting. They ruminate upon what went wrong and they do their best to fix it. Despite the cruelty of the world, THE GOOP HOUSE is a musical sanctuary. I am still scared of them. I am very scared of them.” -????? ♪♫ &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“I Love Goop House.” -Shirin ♪♫ &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“I will never forget the way you looked at me and promised to cover me in slime if I ran into the forest with you toward the strange man.

         <p>The <b>GOOP HOUSE</b> is a online worldwide community of creators. They specialize in revolutionizing genres and doing the unthinkable. These creators participate in <b>GOOP WEEK</b>, a fantastical event in which participants have exactly one week to make a song based on a piece of visual art.<br>&nbsp<br> All proceeds from <b>GOOP WEEK</b> events, streaming, and merch sales during the week go to charity. Our last <b>GOOP WEEK</b> raised over $6,000.<br>&nbsp<br> Creating art from art, as trees host the birth of fungi; what a delightful world artists live in. The universe made us with hands so we might have a chance to share in the act of creation.<br>&nbsp<br>♪♫</p>
